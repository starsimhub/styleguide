# Starsim style guide

This repository contains style and community guidelines for Starsim projects. The style guide is divided into the following sections:

- [1_philosophy.md](1_philosophy.md) — Design philosophy: common tasks should be simple, audience is scientists, and workload/readability matter.
- [2_python.md](2_python.md) — Python style: Google style plus house rules, including no type annotations, longer lines, etc.
- [3_tests.md](3_tests.md) — Testing guidelines.
- [4_documentation.md](4_documentation.md) — Documentation guidelines.
- [5_data.md](5_data.md) — Data use: do not include sensitive data in repos; excise from history if merged.
- [6_zen.md](6_zen.md) — Zen of Starsim: short principles and credos for research and software (simplicity, docs, tests, change).
